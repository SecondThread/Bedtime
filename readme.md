### Your program massively malfunctioned!

You fool! You've bricked my computer!

Don't worry, there's (probably) nothing to worry about! You have 2 minutes from when your computer boots until it
the bedtime program issues the shutdown command. You can force quit the program from windows task manager and then
delete the jar file from your shell:startup folder to stop it from starting again the next time your computer boots.
